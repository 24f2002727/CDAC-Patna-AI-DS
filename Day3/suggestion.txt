The formula used by linspace to calculate step is : 
When endpoint=True (default )
step = (stop - start )/ (num - 1 )

When endpoint=False
step = (stop - start )/ num

When we were mixing int and string , the datatype coming was <U21 , even if
 the the string was of length 1


Reason:

Since the type of the int is int64, the max value of unsigned is 18,446,744,073,
709,551,615. This comes to 20 digit.

when converted to string it's length will be 20 as well, that's why numpy starts 
with capacity of 21 to accommodate max value when converting to string. 

And that's why <U21 , here 21 is capacity not length, if the inputted string
length exceed 21 then it's capacity will be equal to the max string length in a array.

Same goes for the float as well, to accommodate the max value of float64 it's initial 
capacity will be 32 bytes, and if string length exceeds this 32, then max length of 
string present in the array

*Note: capacity >= size*
